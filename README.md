# AI Art Gallery App
* A project to explore and practice the front-end and back-end technologies.


* This project is an excellent opportunity to delve into front-end and back-end technologies while building a web application. Its purpose is to serve as a publicly accessible wallpaper gallery, enabling users to download and upload images based on their preferences. The development process prioritized creating a fully responsive web application that functions seamlessly across various devices.


* The primary aim of this project was to gain practical experience in utilizing HTML5 drag & drop API, FormData API within the WEB API, and implementing jQuery AJAX requests to interact with the back end by sending multipart body data.
